The hard disk that is being used by your instance is probably not big enough. Here I increase mine to 30GB. The hard disk name is the same as the instance name (do not add a new disk, it will not increase your root partition):<br><br><code class=\"language-bash\">gcloud compute disks resize example-disk — size 250</code><br><br>Add your ssh public key to your instance so that you can ssh into your account from your computer.<br><br>After increasing the disk space, copy all your files into the server using <code>scp</code>.<br><br><code class=\"language-bash\">scp * &lt;external_ip_address&gt;:~</code><br><br>Then ssh into your instance and make sure all your files are there.<br><br>Now you need to run <code>docker-compose</code> but it doesn’t exist in Google Cloud Container OS. To do that you need to first create a docker-compose container:<br><br><code class=\"language-bash\">docker run docker/compose:1.13.0 version</code><br><br>and then run this command:<br><br><code class=\"language-bash\">docker run --rm \\</code><br><code class=\"language-bash\"> -v /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \\</code><br><code class=\"language-bash\"> -v \"$PWD:$PWD\" \\</code><br><code class=\"language-bash\"> -w=\"$PWD\" \\</code><br><code class=\"language-bash\"> docker/compose:1.13.0 up</code><br><br>I copied these lines from <a href=\"https://cloud.google.com/community/tutorials/docker-compose-on-container-optimized-os\">this tutorial</a>. But, I changed the second command because I kept getting an error saying “can not make directory /rootfs, filesystem is read-only”. That’s why I removed <code>rootfs</code> from my commands.<br><br>After running this command, your docker container should start and should work fine.</p>",
